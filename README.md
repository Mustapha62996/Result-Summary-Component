### Built with

### What I learned
I learnt how to use the @font-face property effectively.
I have also improved in using Flexbox and Media Queries


```html
<h1>Font face Demo</h1>
```
```css
@font-face{
  font-family: HankenGrotesk-Bold;
  src: url(./assets/fonts/static/HankenGrotesk-Bold.ttf);
}
h1{
  font-family: HankenGrotesk-Bold;
  font-size: 24px;
}
```

### Continued development

I'm going to further improve myself in certain areas in CSS like Media Queries and Flexbox 


### Useful resources
